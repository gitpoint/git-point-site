          Every currently available client that I tried to use was either too simple (single-feature), required payment for the most
          basic of features (such as commenting on an issue) and/or didn't have the best UI.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 dark-gray lh-copy mw7">
          I was pretty suprised that I couldn't find a single client that I enjoyed using, so I built this bad boy with the help of
          some amazing contributors.

          When you authenticate your account with GitPoint, your access token is stored in your device with encryption. It's virtually
          impossible for us to retrieve that information. We never view a user's access token or GitHub data whatsoever.
          It's not possible even if we wanted to.
